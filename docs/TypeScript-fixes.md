# TypeScript Issue Fixes

We resolved several TypeScript issues in the Material Manager codebase:

## 1. processingTypes.ts

- Fixed type errors in the `applyProcessingRules` function where value assignment operations were incompatible with TypeScript's strict typing
- Added `as any` type assertions to several property assignments where TypeScript couldn't determine the exact type
- Corrected return type handling in various mapping and transformation functions

## 2. Material Interface in types.ts

- Extended the `Material` interface to include legacy field properties:
  - `nume`: Name of the material (string)
  - `tip`: Type information (string)
  - `descriere`: Description (string)
  - `stare`: Status information (string)
- These legacy fields are needed for backward compatibility with older components that still use them

## 3. MaterialComponents.tsx

- Fixed the component filtering to use `type` instead of `tip` for compatibility with the updated Material schema
- Updated the `getAllComponentsRecursive` function to properly handle both string IDs and Material objects
- Added proper type for table rows with a new `TableRow` interface instead of using `any[]`

## 4. ProcessingView.tsx

- Fixed React dependency array in useEffect hook by adding `outputConfig.processingType` as a dependency

## Testing

- The application now builds successfully without TypeScript errors
- The fixes maintain backward compatibility with older code while enabling the new processing types functionality

These changes allow the application to leverage the new processing types configuration system without breaking existing functionality.
